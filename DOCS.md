#### <https://api.openai.com/v1/completions>

#### Request body:

- **model:**
string, Required
- **prompt:** 
string or array, Required
The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, 
array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

- **best_of:** 
integer or null, Optional Defaults to 1
Generates best_of completions server-side and returns the "best"
(the one with the highest log probability per token). 
Results cannot be streamed.


- **echo:**
boolean or null ,Optional, Defaults to false
Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion

- **frequency_penalty:**
number or null, Optional, Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens
based on their existing frequency in the text so far, 
decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.
See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

- **logit_bias:** 
map, Optional, Defaults to null
Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.
Accepts a json object that maps tokens 
(specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) 
to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this 
tokenizer tool (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert
text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the 
logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect
will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should 
result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.
As an example, you can pass {"50256": -100} to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

- **logprobs:**
integer or null, Optional, Defaults to null
Include the log probabilities on the logprobs most likely
tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if logprobs is 5,
the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. 
The API will always return the logprob of the sampled token,
so there may be up to logprobs+1 elements in the response.
The maximum value for logprobs is 5.

- **max_tokens:**
integer or null, Optional, Defaults to 16
The maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.
The token count of your prompt plus max_tokens cannot exceed 
the model's context length. Example Python code for counting tokens.

- **n:**
integer or null, Optional, Defaults to 1
How many completions to generate for each prompt.
Note: Because this parameter generates many completions,
it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure
that you have reasonable settings for max_tokens and stop.

- **presence_penalty:**
number or null, Optional, Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens
based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing
the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
See more information about frequency and presence penalties.

- **stop:**
string / array / null, Optional, Defaults to null
Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

- **stream:**
boolean or null, Optional, Defaults to false
Whether to stream back partial progress. 
If set, tokens will be sent as data-only server-sent 
events as they become available, with the stream terminated
by a data: [DONE] message. Example Python code.

- **suffix:**
string or null, Optional, Defaults to null
The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.

- **temperature:**
number or null, Optional, Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. 
Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while 
lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

- **top_p:**
number or null, Optional, Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, 
where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. 
So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

- **user:** 
string, Optional
A unique identifier representing y**our end-user, 
which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. Learn more.

"Content-Type: " \
Authorization: `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`


### Returns:
a chat completion object, or a streamed sequence
of chat completion chunk objects if the request is streamed.

##### The completion object:

{
  "id": " ",
  "object": "text_completion",
  "created":  ,
  "model": " ",
  "choices": [
    {
      "text": " ",
      "index": ,
      "logprobs": ,
      "finish_reason": " "
    }
  ],
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": ,
    "completion_tokens": ,
    "total_tokens": 
  }
}
##### The completion object fields explained:

- **id:** A unique identifier associated with each completion.
- **object:** Indicates the specific endpoint used for the completion (chat/completions or completions).
- **created:** The timestamp indicating when the completion was generated.
- **model:** Specifies the model used for the completion.
- **choices:** A list of completions that were generated. This list can contain multiple completion outputs.
- **usage:** Provides information about token usage, including the number of tokens used for input, output, and the total number of tokens.
- **index:** The index of the completion in the list of responses. This is particularly relevant for the completions endpoint, as multiple completions can be requested.
- **finish_reason:** Specifies why the completion process terminated, with possible values such as stop, length, function call, content filter, or null.

##### The chat completion chunk object:

{
    "id":"chatcmpl-123",
    "object":"chat.completion.chunk",
    "created":1694268190,
    "model":"gpt-3.5-turbo-0613",
    "choices":[{
        "index":0,
        "delta":{
            "role":"assistant",
            "content":""
        },
        "finish_reason":null
        }]
} ....
