# Welcome to Email Analyzer!

## Introduction
This project provides the following analysis for email text:
- **Summary**
- **Sentiment**
- **Sender Awaiting Response**

Each list item is presented with a bullet point and surrounded by ** for bold formatting. This structure will render the list on separate lines when viewed in a Markdown viewer or rendered in a Markdown-compatible environment.

## Project Overview
The project's goal is to process email text input and produce analysis in the three specified categories. 
By leveraging OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model, it aims to provide detailed insights into the text data.

## Model Used

>Also supports some additional features such as inserting text.

## Best practice
Ensure that the input prompts are well-crafted to guide the model effectively and achieve the desired analysis results.
**For optimal results, consider the following prompt tips:**
- **Be Descriptive:** Utilize adjectives and descriptive language in your prompts for more contextual information.
- **Be Specific:** Avoid vague terms and provide precise details to enhance the output's accuracy and clarity.
- **Define the Output:** Request the output in a specific format (e.g., JSON) or provide clear instructions for the desired format.
- **Provide an Example:** Offering an example of the expected output can guide the model and ensure better understanding.
